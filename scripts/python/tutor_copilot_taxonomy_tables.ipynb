pedagogical strategy used in the context below. the examples you will see below come from a 1:1 tutoring session between a tutor and their elementary/middle school student.\\n\\nplease use this codebook to select the strategy that best describes the tutor's pedagogical strategy. we only want you to output the strategy number (e.g. 1).\\n\\n1. explanation of concept: the tutor explains a concept or rule to the student. \\ne.g., right angle is an angle that is exactly 90 degrees and makes a square corner.\\ne.g., if there is an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\\n\\n2. ask a question: the tutor asks the student a question to help them think through the problem.\\ne.g., what number can we multiply the number 10 to get an equal value of 100?\\ne.g., what is the sum of 26,33,21 and 28?\\n\\n3. provide a hint: the tutor provides a hint to the student to help them solve the problem.\\ne.g., let me give you a hint.\\ne.g., hint: find the number of red bouncy balls.\\n\\n4. provide a solution strategy: the tutor provides a strategy to help the student solve the problem. note here, the tutor is not providing the answer but a strategy to help the student solve the problem.\\ne.g., now, we need to find the equivalent fraction of 1/4.\\ne.g., we can order the list according to the hundredths place value.\\n\\n5. prompt explanation: the tutor prompts the student to explain a concept, rule, or their reasoning.\\ne.g., show your work on the whiteboard.\\ne.g., go ahead and try to explain how you got the answer.\\n\\n6. encourage the student: the tutor encourages the student.\\ne.g. that's a good try!\\ne.g., mistakes are an opportunity to learn.\\n\\n7. affirm correct answer: the tutor affirms the student's correct answer.\\ne.g., yes, 20 is the correct answer.\\ne.g., your answer is correct.\\n\\n8. gives away answer or explanation: the tutor provides the answer or explanation to the student.\\ne.g., so, the greatest number will be 7520.\\ne.g., 0.049, 0.4, 0.431, 0.47 order be from least to greatest moving to the hundredths place.\\ne.g., let me explain it to you.\\n\\n9. ask the student to recheck or try again: the tutor asks the student to recheck their work or try again.\\ne.g., please recheck your answer.\\ne.g., would you like to give it another try?\\n\\n10. na: none of the above strategies are used in the context provided.\\nwe consider the following as noise and should be ignored: \\n- transition language: e.g., let's do the next problem. or it's time to show your mastery in today's session.\\n- checking in with the student: e.g., are you there? or let's focus on the session.\\n- starting or ending the session: e.g., let's start the session.\\n- rushing the student: e.g., we are running out of time.\\n- small talk: e.g., how was your day? \\n- talk related to points: e.g., you receive an additional point for your efforts.\\n- talk related to the platform: e.g., let me increase my pace.\\n- question instructions: e.g., in this question, you need to find the ordered pair represents a vertex of the parallelogram that is a reflection of point s across the y-axis.\\n- prompts: e.g., let me know if you need any help along the way. or give it a try.\\n\\nplease label the strategy number that best describes the tutor's pedagogical strategy in the context

whole number.\\n\\n5. start or transition to the exit ticket: the tutor is transitioning to an exit ticket problem. note that the exit ticket is a brief assessment at the end of the tutoring session and is different from the main problems where the tutor is teaching the student.\\ne.g., here is your last exit ticket question.\\ne.g., be ready to use what we practiced to complete the problems in the next section on your own. \\ne.g., go ahead and solve the second exit ticket question.\\n\\n6. during exit ticket attempt: the student is still attempting the exit ticket problem.\\ne.g., i can't

first exit ticket question.\\ne.g., congratulations. you've scored 100% in exit ticket questions.\\n\\n8. closing the session: the tutor is closing the session.\\ne.g., we will continue in the next
